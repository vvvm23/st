# Alex's build of st (Forked from Luke Smith)

## Bindings for

+ **scrollback** with `alt-↑/↓` or `alt-pageup/down` or `shift` while scrolling the mouse
+ OR **vim-bindings**: scroll up/down in history with `alt-k` and `alt-j`. Faster with `alt-u`/`alt-d`.
+ **zoom/change font size**: same bindings as above, but holding down shift as well. `alt-home` returns to default
+ **copy text** with `alt-c`, **paste** is `alt-v` or `shift-insert`

## Pretty stuff

+ Compatibility with `Xresources` and `pywal` for dynamic colors.
+ Default [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colors otherwise.
+ Transparency/alpha, which is also adjustable from your `Xresources`.

## Other st patches

+ Vertcenter
+ Scrollback
+ font2
